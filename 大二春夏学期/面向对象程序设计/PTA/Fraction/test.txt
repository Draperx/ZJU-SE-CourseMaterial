test for 1£¬2£¬3£¬6£¬7£¬9 has been designed. just run the .exe file.

type cast convert to double like 1/3: 0.333333
type cast convert to string like 1/3: 0.333333
ctor default: Default ctor is built! nan
ctor takes one integers as parameters like 12: 12
ctor takes two integers as parameters like 1, 3: 1/3
ctor as copying: 1/3
conversion from a finite decimal string like 1.414: 707/500other test for

============================================
other test can be input and result can be seen throughly.

eg: 2/3 9/7
The sum is: 41/21
The diff is: -13/21
The division is: 14/27
The product is: 6/7
The result of < is: 1
The result of <= is: 1
The result of > is: 0
The result of >= is: 0
The result of != is: 1
The result of == is: 0

eg: 0/1 1/0
There is a fraction using 0 as the denomeinter

eg: -10/7 9/8
The sum is: -17/56
The diff is: -143/56
The division is: -80/63
The product is: -45/28
The result of < is: 1
The result of <= is: 1
The result of > is: 0
The result of >= is: 0
The result of != is: 1
The result of == is: 0

eg: 10/7 -12/5
The sum is: -34/35
The diff is: 134/35
The division is: -25/42
The product is: -24/7
The result of < is: 0
The result of <= is: 0
The result of > is: 1
The result of >= is: 1
The result of != is: 1
The result of == is: 0
