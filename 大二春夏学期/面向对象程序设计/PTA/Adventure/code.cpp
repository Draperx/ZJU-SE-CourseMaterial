/*
* Author: Xuanming, Liu
* Usage:
* This program is a CLI advantrue game,
* When the game starts, the player is in the lobby of the castle. 
* Then the program shows information about the lobbyï¼š
* name of the room, how many exits are there, and names of all exits.
* The player then can input "go" followed by the name of one exit to enter the room connected to that door.
* Once the player enters a room with a monster, 
* the program shows a message and game over. 
* Once the player enters the room of princess, 
* the program shows a message about the princess, 
* and the princess is going to leave with the player. 
* The player then has to find their way out the castle. 
* The only way to leave the castle is via the lobby.
* There are at least three different kinds of rooms,
* and at least five rooms,
* Latest revised: 2020.03.27
